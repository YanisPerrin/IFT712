## Description

The objective of this project is to evaluate 7 classification methods on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, titled "Leaf Classification."

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

### 1. `src` Directory

The `src` directory contains the implementation of classes for classification methods, classes for preprocessing the database, and the notebook presenting the results.

### 2. `data` Directory

The `data` directory holds the data on which the models are trained and tested.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Execution

To utilize the project, execute the notebook located in the `src` directory. A detailed analysis of the results obtained from the various tested classification methods can be found within.

Feel free to consult the report for detailed instructions on running the code and understanding the results.

## Notes

Please ensure compliance with licenses and copyrights associated with the data used in this project. For more information, refer to Kaggle's documentation and legal notices provided with the "Leaf Classification" dataset.
